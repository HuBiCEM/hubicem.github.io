# HuBiCEM: A Prediction-Based Developer Performance and Cost Estimation Model

## Introduction
HuBiCEM (**Hunar Bin Cost Evaluation Model**) is an advanced cost estimation model specifically designed for **agile software development**. Unlike traditional models like **COCOMO**, HuBiCEM evaluates **individual developer performance** rather than relying on a generic team-based approach. By applying **Polynomial Regression**, the model predicts **effort, cost, and time** more accurately, helping software teams plan sprints efficiently.

## Key Features
✔ **Sprint-Based Estimation** – Tracks individual developer effort instead of whole-team estimates.  
✔ **Machine Learning Integration** – Uses **Polynomial Regression** for future sprint predictions.  
✔ **Real-World Validation** – Tested on the **OpenAI Assistant Project** with industry professionals.  
✔ **More Accurate than COCOMO** – Provides estimation results closer to actual project costs.
