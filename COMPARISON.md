## 🔥 Key Insights  

✔ **HuBiCEM produces results closest to actual project outcomes.**  
✔ **COCOMO is less effective for Agile projects due to its reliance on SLOC.**  
✔ **HuBiCEM accounts for individual developer performance and learning curves.**  
✔ **The model is adaptive to sprint-wise estimations, making it more efficient in real-world Agile environments.**  

---

## 📌 Conclusion  
COCOMO is a **traditional model that struggles with Agile environments**, whereas **HuBiCEM adapts to sprint-wise tracking and real-time performance data**. The findings confirm that **HuBiCEM is more reliable for modern Agile projects**.
